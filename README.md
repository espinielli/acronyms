# Acronyms Extension For Quarto

This is just about putting together in a compliant Quarto extension
what has been described in the [issue #6](https://github.com/rchaput/acronymsdown/issues/6#issuecomment-1519101644)
of the [`{acronymsdown}` package](https://rchaput.github.io/acronymsdown).

No claim on my side for any developments or glory out of it!

The real mind behind the Lua filters is [Remy Chaput](https://github.com/rchaput).

## Installing



```bash
quarto add espinielli/acronyms
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

See the [example.qmd](example.qmd) file.
