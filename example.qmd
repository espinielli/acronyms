# Introduction {#intro}

In this example we mix inline and file-based definition of acronyms, just to
show that you can mix the two ways if you wish.

The inline definition is in the YML of this Quarto file:

```yml
acronyms:
  loa_title: "Glossary"
  insert_loa: "end"
  sorting: alphabetical
  keys:
    - shortname: UN
      longname: United Nations
  # Warning! The following path must be either absolute or relative to the 
  # current working directory! 
  # (You can have multiple acronym files)
  fromfile: 
    - _extensions/acronyms/acronyms.yml
```

while the other is defined in the `acronyms.yml` as:

```yml
---
acronyms:
  keys:
    - shortname: RL
      longname: Reinforcement Learning
---
```


## Usage

This paragraph mentions \acr{RL} and \acr{UN} for the first time.

Now, in this paragraph, \acr{RL} is in short form.
And so it is the case for \acr{UN} for that matter.

## Options

All the options are explained in the [the relevant `{acronymsdown}` vignette](https://rchaput.github.io/acronymsdown/articles/options.html).
